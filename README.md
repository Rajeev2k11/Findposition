                                                                        TASKLIST:

The tasklist here are in no order. You are the owner of the project and are required to priortized on what you think is appropriate.

This is a Mini app that can draw rectangle shapes like figma/sketch. You are required to add some logging when shapes are hovered with the mouse. The app is written in React framework. Create a new branch and push your commit. Don't do in master branch.

1 Feature - Mouse coordinates: Hovering any shape should also log the real-time x/y-coordinate of the mouse relative to shape dimension the centre for this relative co-ordinate system should be bottom left point of the shape also the point should shown as integers.

2.Feature- Adding Shapes: here is what should happen after this feature is implemented: a.) if we click anywhere on the window a model should open.b. There should be a form inside the model asking for 4 things top, left, width and height of the shape to be added. c.) submitting that form should add a new shape on the page according to the data field in the form.





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
